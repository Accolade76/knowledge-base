# Scrum 

## Introduction

Notes on the Professional Scrum Master training at Capgemini Academy [09-01-2018 to 10-01-2018]


## First Day 

### Scrum Cycle

#### Roles

- Product Owner (PO)
- Scrum Master
- Development Team member

#### Artifacts

- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Increment

#### Events

- Sprint Planning
- Sprint
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective


#### Product Owner

- Responsible for the product backlog.
- 1 PO can have up to about 3-4 teams under them, but more is probably too complex. Teams should be servicing same product.
- PO has a Product Vision.
- Product Owner is responsible for **value** and has a **mandate**.
- You aren't given a mandate, you **take** a mandate:
    - Talk to your stakeholders
    - Deliver results



#### Scrum Master

- Most important tenets: increase transparency and make sure people communicate!


#### The Sprint

- Storypoints: How much product is it?

##### Sprint Planning

- First sprint event.

###### Inputs

- Velocity (from earlier sprints)
- Capacity of team
- Definition of Done (measured against product)
- Improvement actions (from previous retrospective)
- What
- How

###### Outputs

- Sprint Goal: Why are we doing this sprint?
- Sprint Backlog: This is the plan to meet the goal.


##### Sprint

- How you decide on sprint length:
    - What is the value of the feedback I receive?
    - What does it cost to get feedback?

- On a daily board:
    - Tasks should be clear deliverables (Not build/test/analysis)

##### Team

- 6 +/- 3 members
- Self-organizing
- Cross-functional
- Don't focus on people, but on creating an environment in which scrum flourishes. There are only 'Developers' in the 'Development team' and no other roles.


##### Sprint Review

- We delivered what we planned, what are we going to do next.
- Present: the dev Team, the PO, and the stakeholders.
- The review is for the PO: he can show what has been done with his product and where it's going next
- The review should make a change to the Product Backlog (otherwise you have to wonder about how the sprint went)
- Have VIP stakeholders as a standard invite to your review, even if they never show up. These are people that can hurt your work/team if they feel out-of-the-loop. For the rest, be mindful of whom you invite and they should be relevant to the sprint goal.

###### Ideal format

- Short explanation of what the point is of the Sprint Review.
- Review of what was on the sprint backlog and what got done.
- A demo of the things that got done.
- Ask everyone present: "How can we make this better?" (Preferable over: "What do you think?").
- Look at the Product Backlog and discuss next steps/completion dates.

##### Sprint Retrospective

- This is an event for the Scrum Master. 
- The only people in attendance are the Scrum Team (PO, Scrum Master, Dev team)


##### Increment

- Next iteration of the product which should meet the Definition of Done and be shippable.

## Second Day

### Certification Exam Tips

1. Read the Scrum Guide and **know** it!
2. Read the course training material (unfortunately, I cannot make this available as it is copyrighted intellectual property)
3. Do the open assessments on the scrum.org site multiple times (ideally until you don't see any new questions in your run-throughs). Especially, the open scrumYou can also do the PSPO and other open assessments.
4. Know the Glossary.
5. Google is your friend!
6. Be a 'scrumdamentalist' (copyright: Peter Kuijt). The exam focuses on the view of the framework as decided by founder Ken Schwaber, don't get creative and veer off the theory by thinking 'Well, in practice, xyz can happen...'.

### Done and Undone

- Product owner is responsible for inspecting that something is 'Done' based on the Definition of Done.
- The Definition of Done belongs to the Development Team.
