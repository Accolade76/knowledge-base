## Workshop Information

## Introduction

> "The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed" - Peter Block

**Mob Programming:** All the brilliant minds working together
on the same thing... 
at the same time... 
in the same space... 
at the same computer... 

Ideally, we should mob with as many different roles as possible, not just developers. Diversity helps.

> Joshua Kerievsky: "Mob Programming is the continuous integration of ideas."

> "The people doing the work can best determine how to manage that work"

### Set up

1. Everyone on one side of the table, high resolution screen on the other
2. Comfortable chairs
3. Multiple keyboards for different preferences (if needed)
4. It's preferable to have the work space set up to serve the team: white boards, post-its, etc.

### Way of Working

1. Team stays engaged in a mob. It's nicer to work together, not in a trench by yourself.
2. People can check out any time they like. Take a break, go work on their own things.

## General Notes

### Why would we work this way?

Woody:

- Knowledge sharing
- Continuous code and design review
- Many perspectives on the work
- Rapid feedback
- We focus on the right things
- Higher quality (3 years, 40 projects, 3 bugs)
- Better solutions
- Eliminate queues and reduce inventory
- Enhance the flow of the work
- More fun, less stressful, more engaging...etc.

---
- "Super-brain"
- Shared Learning
- Shared Understanding
- Feeling like you got things done (at the end of the day)
- Be efficient about working more effectively. 

#### For Managers

- Because the team decided to.

## How it Started

### Conditions for working (Woody's demands) 

1. No interference
2. I can cancel or postpone any work
3. No Estimates
4. No Projects (Alan Kelly...read his books...beyond projects)
5. 
6. Weekly Team Practice. 3 hours every Friday.
7. We focused on getting good results from our retrospectives. (Woody prefers a daily retrospective) - "Turn up the good".

## Tips

- Read by refactoring (just refactor the code) instead of only reading it.
- Product flow (Daniel Rheinerdsen??)

### The Concept of Mob Programming

1. We optimize for the flow of the work rather than for the output of the individual. (It's not about speed)
1. We are NOT trying to get the most of each person...we seek to get the best of each of us into everything we do.
1. It is NOT: 5 people watching 1 person coding.
 
### The Technique of Mob Programming

1. Driver/Navigator (Pair Programming) "It's like a Rally Car race."
2. ~~Driver/Observer - The person with the idea, takes the keyboard and the observer tries to follow along (kills engagement as the observer can't follow what's going on).~~

#### Driver

> I'd like us to conceptually consider the Driver as being an extension of the computer.

Smart Input Operator - Liberates the team to focus on the right stuff (The Problem, Solution, Design - not "the code")

- Helps the team remain in the flow
- Caution: Can easily block flow
- There is no "hard and fast" rule

#### Navigators

- Working together in the Same Context
- Sharing the Cognitive Load
- Dialogue - Talking, Listening
- Visual thinking with whiteboards, flip charts, sticky notes, index cards
- Sharing and integrating ideas
- Contribute the right thing
   - ...at the right time
   - ...in the right way

> Pause (in psychology): Pause and count to ten (deliberately), then don't say it.

#### Visual Communication

- Use the white board
- Temporary Memory Location
- Drawings and Diagrams
- Sticky Notes, Index Cards


#### Hearing and Understanding Others

- Learn to Listen
- Strive to understand
- Be willing to try other people's ideas
- Open space for others to talk 


### Wiio's Law and Mob Programming.

The fundamental [Wiio's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws) states that

> "Communication usually fails, except by accident". The full set of laws is as follows:

1. Communication usually fails, except by accident.
    1. If communication can fail, it will.
    1. If communication cannot fail, it still most usually fails.
    1. If communication seems to succeed in the intended way, there's a misunderstanding.
    1. If you are content with your message, communication certainly fails.
1. If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage.
1. There is always someone who knows better than you what you meant with your message.
1. The more we communicate, the worse communication succeeds.
   1. The more we communicate, the faster misunderstandings propagate.
1. In mass communication, the important thing is not how things are but how they seem to be.
1. The importance of a news item is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
1. The more important the situation is, the more probable you had forgotten an essential thing that you remembered a moment ago.

## Coding Dojo

1. Safe space
2. Practicing together without chaos

3 roles:

- Driver
- Navigator - Understands and shares an idea, has the idea and guides the Driver, expresses their intention at a high level
- Observers
    - Quietly and patiently...
