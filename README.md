# Agile Development Knowledge Base 

## Introduction

In the past few years I've grown increasingly fascinated with all the different facets of agile software development and the practices related to this. Furthermore, returning from a management role to go back into working in code and on technical topics has been a fascinating path.

I still have a long way to go, and a lot to learn, and I felt it might be helpful to chronicle my discoveries in the form of a Github knowledge base.

It servers primarily as a literal repository of knowledge for me to find back links to interesting pages, books, tools, blog posts, courses and tools.

But hopefully there'll be something here for you too.

Feel free to browse.
