# Java Language Notes

## Introduction

This page contains links to learning resources for learning the Java programming language.

Further down, I will place notes for myself as I go through the learning path. It may or may not be useful to you, but I'm hoping the initial resources and my comments on my experiences with the different courses will help you find your way.
