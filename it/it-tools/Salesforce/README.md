# Salesforce

# Introduction

Salesforce is a powerful cloud platform for developing and managing CRM tools but also can be leveraged for many more things.

## Introduction to APEX

These are my notes for learning Salesforce via the Pluralsight course by [David Liu](https://sfdc99.com) called ["Apex Academy: Absolute Beginner's Guide to Coding in Salesforce"](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=apex-absolute-beginner-guide-coding-salesforce&author=david-liu&name=apex-absolute-beginner-guide-coding-salesforce-m2&clip=0&mode=live)

## Declarative Toolset

There are several built-in tools that do not require (much) development skill to use:

- Workflow Rules: Same object updates, E-mail Notifications
- Process Builder: Related object updates, Create a record
- Visual Flow: Unrelated object updates, variables & loops

## Coding Toolset

### Back-end 

- Apex triggers: programming language based on events
- Apex classes: salesforce objects
- SOQL: Salesforce Object Query Language
  
### UI Level

- VisualForce (going to be deprecated slowly)
- Lightning (New Langauage being rolled out.)
