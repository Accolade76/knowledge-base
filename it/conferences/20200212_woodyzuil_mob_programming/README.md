## Workshop Information

_Date_: 12-02-2020
Trainer: Woody Zuil (@woodyzuil)

## Introduction

> "The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed" - Peter Block

**Mob Programming:** All the brilliant minds working together
on the same thing... 
at the same time... 
in the same space... 
at the same computer... 

Ideally, we should mob with as many different roles as possible, not just developers. Diversity helps.

> Joshua Kerievsky: "Mob Programming is the continuous integration of ideas."

> "The people doing the work can best determine how to manage that work"

### Set up

1. Everyone on one side of the table, high resolution screen on the other
2. Comfortable chairs
3. Multiple keyboards for different preferences (if needed)
4. It's preferable to have the work space set up to serve the team: white boards, post-its, etc.

### Way of Working

1. Team stays engaged in a mob. It's nicer to work together, not in a trench by yourself.
2. People can check out any time they like. Take a break, go work on their own things.
3.
