## First Day 

### Scrum Cycle

#### Product Owner

- Responsible for the product backlog.
- 1 PO can have up to about 3-4 teams under them, but more is probably too complex. Teams should be servicing same product.
- PO has a Product Vision.
- Product Owner is responsible for **value** and has a **mandate**.
- You aren't given a mandate, you **take** a mandate:
    - Talk to your stakeholders
    - Deliver results



#### Scrum Master

- Most important tenets: increase transparency and make sure people communicate!
