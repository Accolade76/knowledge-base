### Mikado Method

1. Try to do your change
1. Check for regressions
1. Try trivial fixes (Scratch refactoringÂ§)

- Regression criteria
 - tests
 - compilation

### Tips

- Using a parking method for more detailed refactorings. Log them in the graph to come back to them some other time instead of getting stuck in an endless refactor loop.
