## Introduction
I'm constantly teaching myself all sorts of skills. Many of them are IT-related, but not all of them are. I've decided I want a central repository to store things like cheat-sheets for software development tools I use, or to store snippets of code and commands I don't want to forget or lose, or to store a link for a page I don't want to lose sight of.

Sure, I could use a tool like Evernote for most of this stuff. But I love hacking on the command-line and trying to optimize the Vim text editor to take over the world, so I figured Git and GitHub would be the perfect place for this!

Feel free to browse and use what you like. I don't guarantee the quality, accuracy or even relevancy of anything you find here. These are my personal notes stored in a public space for the good (or detriment) of (wo)mankind.
