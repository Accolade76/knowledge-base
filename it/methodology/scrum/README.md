# Scrum 

## Introduction

Notes on the Professional Scrum Master training at Capgemini Academy [09-01-2018 to 10-01-2018]


## First Day 

### Scrum Cycle

#### Roles

- Product Owner (PO)
- Scrum Master
- Development Team member

#### Artifacts

- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Increment

#### Events

- Sprint Planning
- Sprint
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective


#### Product Owner

- Responsible for the product backlog.
- 1 PO can have up to about 3-4 teams under them, but more is probably too complex. Teams should be servicing same product.
- PO has a Product Vision.
- Product Owner is responsible for **value** and has a **mandate**.
- You aren't given a mandate, you **take** a mandate:
    - Talk to your stakeholders
    - Deliver results



#### Scrum Master

- Most important tenets: increase transparency and make sure people communicate!


#### The Sprint

- Storypoints: How much product is it?

##### Sprint Planning

- First sprint event.

###### Inputs

- Velocity (from earlier sprints)
- Capacity of team
- Definition of Done (measured against product)
- Improvement actions (from previous retrospective)
- What
- How

###### Outputs

- Sprint Goal: Why are we doing this sprint?
- Sprint Backlog: This is the plan to meet the goal.


##### Sprint

- How you decide on sprint length:
    - What is the value of the feedback I receive?
    - What does it cost to get feedback?

- On a daily board:
    - Tasks should be clear deliverables (Not build/test/analysis)

##### Team

- 6 +/- 3 members
- Self-organizing
- Cross-functional
- Don't focus on people, but on creating an environment in which scrum flourishes. There are only 'Developers' in the 'Development team' and no other roles.


##### Sprint Review

- We delivered what we planned, what are we going to do next.
- Present: the dev Team, the PO, and the stakeholders.
- The review is for the PO: he can show what has been done with his product and where it's going next
- The review should make a change to the Product Backlog (otherwise you have to wonder about how the sprint went)

##### Sprint Retrospective

- This is an event for the Scrum Master. 
- The only people in attendance are the Scrum Team (PO, Scrum Master, Dev team)


##### Increment

- Next iteration of the product which should meet the Definition of Done and be shippable.
