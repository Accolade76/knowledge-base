# Vim

## Introduction

This tool really requires no introduciton. I started learning vi and vim (vImproved) when I started hacking in unix and linux. As it's a pretty ubiquitous text editor in those environments and insanely powerful, I've found that taking the effort to scale the steep learning curve is well worth the effort.

I'm constantly flabbergasted by how much powerful functionality has been packed into this editor and how relevant it still is today.
